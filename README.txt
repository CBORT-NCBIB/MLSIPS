Maximum-Likelihood Single Input Polarization Sensitive Processing

Works on OFDI data acquired with polarization diverse detection and sufficient system PMD

...:::... StarterScript.m ...:::...
Presents how to analyze tomogram data with SIPS processing given a system compensation structure and a
tomogram acquired with polarization diverse detection


...:::... SystemCompensationStarterScript.m ...:::...
Presents how to compute a system compensation structure given and a large sampling of Stokes vectors or tomograms
acquired with polarization diverse detection. Shows how to assess to overall spectral polarization spread of the system
and estimates overall reliability
